2: Self Mutilating Page

    Due Feb 10 by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a file upload File Types zip, tgz, bzip, and gz

Using the power of JavaScript, we will handle user initiated events and modify the structure and content of the web page. Construct a web page that has some elements that a user can interact with when viewed in a web browser.

Requirements:

    Implement a handler for at least two different event types.
    At least one event handler should call preventDefault or stopPropagation.
    Provide a comment in that handler that explains why the call to preventDefault or stopPropagation is necessary.
    You must change at least one attribute of at least one element via JS.
    You must remove at least one element from the DOM via JS.
    You must create and add at least one element to the DOM via JS.
    Upload a compressed archive to Canvas containing the HTML file and any supporting files as needed to view locally (style sheets, JavaScript source, images, etc).

Suggestions:

    The theme of the page is entirely up to you, but I'm looking for something that is mildly cohesive such as a webpage calculator, a game board, or a note taking tool.
    This is meant to be a stand alone web page, so there is no need to worry about interacting with any back-end services or saving entered information.
    You may iterate this tool into your course project.
    You can do something completely unrelated to your project.

Important Note:

    You are still expected to write valid HTML
