1: Resume/CV in HTML/CSS

    Due Feb 3 by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a file upload File Types zip, tgz, bzip, and gz

Using only HTML and CSS, you will create a resume. Preferably your own, but doesn't actually matter. It should list contact information, some sort of objective tailored to getting a job at Awesome Co, Manufacturers of Gourmet Widgets, work experience, education, list of skills, and anything else you consider important.

Requirements:

    Write semantic HTML.
    Write a base style sheet and a print-only style sheet.
        There should be elements only visible in print or on screen.
    Include a multimedia item (picture, video, audio recording of your manifesto) that does not appear when printing.
    Print to PDF.
    Upload a compressed archive containing the two style sheets, the multimedia item, the HTML file, and the PDF.

Suggestions:

    Use MDN (developer.mozilla.org).
    Use a text editor with syntax highlighting such as VSCode, Sublime Text, Notepad++, vim.
    Check the validity of your mark up using https://validator.w3.org/ 

    Links to an external site.

Important Note:

    In the Rubric, with respect to Styles, "good" means default style sheets are overridden in a meaningful way and it is clear the student attempted to create a pleasing layout. Extra credit may be awarded if the grader believes the student was exceptionally successful in the attempt.
