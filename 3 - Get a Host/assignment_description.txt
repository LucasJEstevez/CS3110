3: Get a Host

    Due Monday by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a website url

In this assignment, we will spin up a server on the wild world wide web! The webserver will perform basic file serving, allowing anyone in the world to GET web pages and supporting files. You will submit a URL to access the main page on your web server.

We will go over getting a publicly accessible virtual machine on Linode and setting it up with an nginx server in class, but you are free to satisfy the requirements how you like.

Requirements:

    The web server must be publicly accessible over the Internet.
    The web server must be accessible via a non-cloud provider host name.
    The web server must support HTTPS.
    There must be at least two separate HTML pages.
    There must be a links between the pages.
    There must be at least one style sheet that all pages share.
    There must be at least one other hypermedia item embedded in the pages that is hosted on your server (image, audio, video).

Tips:

    We will go over setting up a Linode with nginx, a domain name, and HTTPS through Let's Encrypt in class. You should attend class.
    To get a Linode account with a 2-month $100 credit, go to https://www.linode.com/lp/refer/?r=45ffb4c8fcedfc76ed83e4e62095666c8f09bd17

To get SSL installed in nginx, follow the instructions at https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=pip
